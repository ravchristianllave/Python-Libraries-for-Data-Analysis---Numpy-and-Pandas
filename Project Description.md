# About this Coursera Project

This is a project I took from Coursera to tackle all the fundamentals for the two most important Python libraries - Numpy and Pandas. Step-by-step tasks are first introduced prior the final project:

**Task #1:** define single and multi-dimensional NumPy arrays

**Task #2:** leverage NumPy built-in methods and functions

**Task #3:** perform mathematical operations in NumPy

**Task #4:** perform arrays slicing and indexing

**Task #5:** perform elements selection (conditional)

**Task #6:** understand pandas fundamentals

**Task #7:** pandas with csv and html data

**Task #8:** pandas operations

**Task #9:** pandas with functions

**Task #10:** perform sorting and ordering in pandas
